## Digital Art with Transformations
Having already worked with trigonometric functions and [the rotate() function](https://github.com/mike-leo-k/intro-to-im/blob/master/june%203), I decided to apply the concepts I observed in class, including the translate() function and scaling the the trigonometric function.

I first translated a sine graph (without scaling, generated by plotting points), with the following result:

Then, scaling the graph by a fact of 10:

Then, using a for() loop, with pushMatrix() at the beginning followed by an incremental downward translation (using translat(0, i), i += 15) and a subsequent popMatric(), I repeated the sine graph throughout the screen:

## Data Visualization
Inspired by [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), one of the earliest video games created, Pong Practice is a simple one person video game intended to allow the player to "practice" Pong. Instead of two paddles, there is only paddle to the right of the screen, and the objective is to prevent a bouncing ball from touching the right edge. Pong Practice emulates practicing tennis/table tennis/lacrosse shots against a wall.

The code that runs the game uses object-oriented programming to define the paddle and the ball as objects, as well as defining the various functions that can be applied to them.

## Challenges/Discoveries
* Figuring out how to navigate between three separate screens (I envisioned the game to have a start screen and a game over screen in addition to actual gameplay) was challenging. I settled on checking a variable for one three values in an if-else chain in void main(), but unfortunately didn't have enough time to implement it.
* Because I wanted to use the up and down arrow keys, the keyPressed() function wouldn't work. I learned you could use keyCode instead.
* Used text that constantly updates to reflect the score.
* Got a little lost in all the coordinate arithmetic I had to do to accurately check the position of the ball with relation to the paddle.
