## Digital Art with Transformations
Having already worked with trigonometric functions and [the rotate() function](https://github.com/mike-leo-k/intro-to-im/blob/master/june%203), I decided to apply the concepts I observed in class, including the translate() function and scaling the the trigonometric function. The final code is [here](https://github.com/mike-leo-k/intro-to-im/blob/master/june%207/digital_art_transformed.pde).

I first translated a sine graph (without scaling, generated by plotting points), with the following result:

</p>

Then, scaling the graph by a fact of 10:

</p>

Then, using a for() loop, with pushMatrix() at the beginning followed by an incremental downward translation (using translat(0, i), i += 15) and a subsequent popMatric(), I repeated the sine graph throughout the screen:

</p>

Now, when rotating the coordinate system (with the rotate() transformation), translation is also required for the drawings to be displayed on screen. Implementing the function in the last step, I added a second for loop that would draw the same graphs vertically as well:

</p>

Using strokeWeight(), I increased the size of the points (and thus the graphs):

</p>

Finally, using random(255) in the stroke(R, G, B) function, I set each point on each graph to have a random color:

## Challenges/Discoveries
* Figuring out how to properly scale up the sine graph. Realizing that the x coroodinate needed to be proportionally scaled as well seems obvious in retrospect.
* I first tried using the fill() function to change the color of the points, but googling told me that stroke() controlled the colors of points.
* Calculating how much translation was required post-rotation. Thinking of the coordinate system as a movable graph sheet really helped.

## Data Visualization

### Basic Analysis of the 1988 Seoul Olympics Participants & Winners
Having already collected data on this event for another project, I decided to use Processing to complete a simple data visualization of the compiled information. The data on the number of medals won was collected from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics_medal_table).

The 1988 Olympics were notable for several reasons: it was the first Olympics event with participation from all major blocs in international politics, following two consecutive events that were boycotted by various countries; it was the last Olympics event attended by the Soviet Union; finally, no nation has ever come close to the Soviet Union's utter domination of the medal table, with 55 gold medals and 132 medals in total.

I decided to analyze the performance of countries identified as communist states, due to the fact that most of these states would no longer exist by the following Olympics. A communist country is defined as a state that is administered and governed by a single communist party guided by Marxismâ€“Leninism. I identified communist states using [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state#List_of_communist_states) list.

The compiled list of countries, with their total medals and their status as a communist state (1 if they were, 0 if they were not) looked like this:

### Pong Practice in action

## Challenges/Discoveries
* Figuring out how to navigate between three separate screens (I envisioned the game to have a start screen and a game over screen in addition to actual gameplay) was challenging. I settled on checking a variable for one three values in an if-else chain in void main(), but unfortunately didn't have enough time to implement it.
* Because I wanted to use the up and down arrow keys, the keyPressed() function wouldn't work. I learned you could use keyCode instead.
* Used text that constantly updates to reflect the score.
* Got a little lost in all the coordinate arithmetic I had to do to accurately check the position of the ball with relation to the paddle.
