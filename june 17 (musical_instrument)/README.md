# Production Assignment: Sweet Theremin O' Mine

## Description
Initially intended to be simply mimic the frequency modulation of a theremin, I decided to incorporate two modes into the device, switching between them using a push button. The default mode would play the opening riff of Guns N' Roses' "Sweet Child O' Mine".

The tempo of the riff is controlled by input from the ultrasonic sensor.

The method through which the ultrasonic sensor determines the distance between itself and whatever object is placed in front of it is explained in the [code comments](https://github.com/mike-leo-k/intro-to-im/blob/master/june%2017%20(musical_instrument)/sweet_theremin_o_mine.ino) and on [the Arduino reference website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_ultrasonic_sensor.htm).
