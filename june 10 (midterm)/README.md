# Production Assignment: Jet Fighter Portal

## Description
Inspired by [Jet Fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Fighter_(video_game)), 2 player arcade game created by Atari, and [Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)), a puzzle-platform game created by valve, Jet Fighter Portal combines the dogfight mechanics of Jet Fighter with the teleportation mechanics of Portal. 

In Jet Fighter, the players fly in simulated jets around the screen, engaging in a dogfight and attempting to score hits on their opponent within a limited amount of time. Currently, Jet Fighter Portal only supports one "player", without a clear goal for the game.

Controlling the jet and shooting bullets is nearly identical to the style of Jet Fighter, with the addition of being able to speed up the jet as well.

Portal consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes.

The mechanics of teleportation is emulated in 2D in Jet Fighter Portal, where the jet can both fire and teleport through portals. The bullet fired from the jet can also teleport through the portals. The color and limited number of portals generated is also designed to emulate the game.

The game consists of three screens: the initial screen, which is exited by pressing any keys; the game screen itself where the jet can be operated; and the end screen which displays a final message. The opening and end screen play two different pieces of 8-bit theme music, while the game screen plays sounds when bullets and portals are being fired.
