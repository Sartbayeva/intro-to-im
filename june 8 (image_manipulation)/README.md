# Production Assignment: Image Manipulation
Since this assignment was fairly open-ended, I decided 

I first translated a sine graph (without scaling, generated by plotting points), with the following result:

</p>

Then, scaling the graph by a fact of 10:

</p>

Then, using a for() loop, with pushMatrix() at the beginning followed by an incremental downward translation (using translat(0, i), i += 15) and a subsequent popMatric(), I repeated the sine graph throughout the screen:

</p>

Now, when rotating the coordinate system (with the rotate() transformation), translation is also required for the drawings to be displayed on screen. Implementing the function in the last step, I added a second for loop that would draw the same graphs vertically as well:

</p>

Using strokeWeight(), I increased the size of the points (and thus the graphs):

</p>

Finally, using random(255) in the stroke(R, G, B) function, I set each point on each graph to have a random color:

### Challenges/Discoveries
* Figuring out how to properly scale up the sine graph. Realizing that the x coroodinate needed to be proportionally scaled as well seems obvious in retrospect.
* I first tried using the fill() function to change the color of the points, but googling told me that stroke() controlled the colors of points.
* Calculating how much translation was required post-rotation. Thinking of the coordinate system as a movable graph sheet really helped.
