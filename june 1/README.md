## Challenges/Discoveries
* Finding out the RGB values of my target colors took longer than I thought.
* Realized I could play around with line thickness using the strokeWeight() function.
* Also figured out how to do simple animations from the sample code in the lecture notes, so I gave it a shot with the eyes.
