## Description
Self portrait (although it is considerably better looking than I am), made with simple commands and shapes in Processing 3.5.4

## Screenshot of output:

## Challenges/Discoveries
Finding out the RGB values of my target colors took longer than I thought.
Figured out how to do simple animations from the sample code in the lecture notes, so I gave it a shot with the eyes.
