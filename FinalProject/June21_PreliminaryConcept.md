Mimic Guitar Hero interface with processing, while creating a mini guitar-shaped controller using Arduino. I'll probably settle for four buttons rather than five, and limit the playing modes to 'Easy' and 'Medium'. 

The general idea is to press the buttons correlated to the notes as they reach the bottom of the screen. In the original game, there is a strumming bar which needs to be used in tandem with the buttons. I'll do my best to figure it out but I might settle for coordinating just the buttons.

I'm thinking I'll be able to chart songs by entering data into a CSV file, with four columns for each button.

If I'm not able to figure out how to make this work, I'll just develop my midterm project further, which I've already incorporated Arduino controls into. I'm thinking ofmaybe coding an enemy jet for a single player mode.
