My final project will mimic the classic arcade game Guitar Hero's interface using Processing, while incorporating a mini guitar-shaped controller using Arduino. I'll probably settle for four buttons rather than five, and limit the playing modes to 'Easy' and 'Medium' (harder modes require five buttons).

The general idea is to press the buttons correlated to the notes as they reach the bottom of the screen. In the original game, there is a strumming bar which needs to be used in tandem with the buttons. I'll do my best to figure it out but I might settle for coordinating the buttons alone.

I'm thinking I'll be able to chart songs (code the falling notes) by entering data into a CSV file, with four columns for each button.
