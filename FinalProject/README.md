## Description
Processing Hero is a clone of the popular music rhythm video game series [*Guitar Hero*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero). It is designed to emulate as much of the gameplay and aesthetic of the original game through the Java-based software sketchbook [Processing](https://processing.org) combined with the open-source physical computing prototyping platform [Arduino](https://arduino.cc).

Two prototypes of the game were designed, in order to explore different priorities in gameplay. The shared characteristics included the visuals, which were 3-dimensional falling notes of four colors on four strings as pictured above. The 3D transformations were achieved by specifying the [P3D render mode](https://processing.org/tutorials/p3d/) in setup.

## Challenges & Discoveries
* Figuring out how to render the game in 3D was quite difficult, but finding a [comprehensive tutorial](https://medium.com/@behreajj/3d-transformations-in-processing-de11acdd1fbc) along with the [P3D](https://processing.org/tutorials/p3d/) reference page was extremely useful. I able able to achieve the desired level of rotation around the X-axis and translation along the Z=axis through trial and error.
